# The-smart-Cleaning-System
Hey there! Welcome to the repo!<br/><br/>
This is a 3rd semester Electronics project made by a group of 6 students:
- Laxmi Sreenivas
- Sai Teja
- Sashank
- Rithvik
- Surya Vamsi
- Ram
<br />
We designed a basic automated cleaning system, a rover, that picks up dirt and mops the floor avoiding various obstacles. This repo consists of the source code, project report, and a video demonstration of it's working.
